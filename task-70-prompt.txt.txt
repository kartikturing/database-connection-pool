Database connection pool configuration

Description: Configure a high-performance database connection pool, such as HikariCP (the default in Spring Boot 2+), in a Spring Boot application. The task is to explicitly set key performance and reliability properties in the application.properties or application.yml file. This includes setting maximum-pool-size, minimum-idle, connection-timeout, and max-lifetime.

Skills Tested: Database connection pooling, performance tuning, and Spring Boot configuration properties.
